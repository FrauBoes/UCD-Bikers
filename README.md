## Quick Start

Run the application:

    make run

And open it in the browser at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).



## Prerequisites

The application is built to be used with Python 3. Update `Makefile` to switch to Python 2 if needed.

Some Flask dependencies are compiled during installation, so `gcc` and Python header files need to be present.
For example, on Ubuntu:

    apt install build-essential python3-dev



## Development environment and release process

 - Create virtualenv with Flask and UCD-Bikers installed into it (latter is installed in
   [develop mode](http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#development-mode) which allows
   modifying source code directly without a need to re-install the app): `make venv`

 - Run development server in debug mode: `make run`; Flask will restart if source code is modified

 - Run tests: `make test` (see also: [Testing Flask Applications](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/testing/))

 - Create source distribution: `make sdist` (will run tests first)

 - To remove virtualenv and built distributions: `make clean`

 - To add more python dependencies: add to `install_requires` in `setup.py`

 - To modify configuration in development environment: edit file `settings.cfg`; this is a local configuration file
   and it is *ignored* by Git - make sure to put a proper configuration file to a production environment when
   deploying


## Deployment


    git clone https://github.com/FrauBoes/UCD-Bikers.git


Check out [Deploying with Fabric](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/fabric/#fabric-deployment) on one of the
possible ways to automate the deployment.

- Build a package (`make sdist`)

- Deliver it to a server and install it (`pip install bikers.tar.gz`)

- Ensure that configuration file exists and `BIKERS_SETTINGS` environment variable points to it

- Ensure that user has access to the working directory to create and write log files in it

- Run a [WSGI container](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/wsgi-standalone/) with the application.
And, most likely, it will also run behind a [reverse proxy](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/wsgi-standalone/#proxy-setups).
